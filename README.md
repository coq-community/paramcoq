The plugin is still in an experimental state. It is not very user friendly (lack of good error messages) and still contains bugs. But is useable enough to "translate" a large chunk of standard library.

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Paramcoq
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-paramcoq
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/coq-community/paramcoq.git
cd paramcoq
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
make install
```


Available commands
------------------

The default arity is 2.

- Parametricity *ident* as *name* [arity *n*].

Declare the translation named *name* from the translation of the constant or inductive *ident*.

- Parametricity [Recursive] *ident* [arity *n*] [qualified].

The default name for the translation of the constant or inductive *ident* is automatically generated (from its unqualified name).
You can use the `Recursive` option to recursively translate all the constants and inductives which are used by *ident*.
You can use the `qualified` option to use a qualified default name for the translated constants and inductives. The default name then has the form `Module_o_Submodule_o_ident` if *ident* lies in the `Module.Submodule` namespace.

- Parametricity Translation *term* [as *name*] [arity *n*].

Define a new constant named *name* obtained by computing the parametricity translation of *term*.

- Parametricity Module *modulepath*.

Recursively translate everything in a module.

- Realizer *constant or variable* [as *name*] [arity *n*] := *term*.

Declare *term* to be the translation of a constant.
Useful to translate terms containing section variables, or axioms.

Note that both translating a term or module may lead to proof obligations (for some fixpoints and opaque terms if you did not import `ProofIrrelevence`).

- [Global | Local] Parametricity Tactic := t.

Use the tactic t to solve proof obligations generated by the `Parametricity` command.
